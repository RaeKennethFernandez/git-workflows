# Git Workflow Guidelines

This repository provides a structured and standardized Git workflow for collaborative development. It ensures smooth branching, clear commit messages, consistent pull requests, effective code reviews, organized releases, and efficient handling of hotfixes and bugfixes.

## Workflow Overview
1. Use feature branches for all new work.
2. Follow the commit message conventions.
3. Create pull requests for all merges into `develop` or `main`.
4. Conduct code reviews before merging.
5. Tag all releases using semantic versioning.
6. Handle hotfixes with priority and merge them into both `main` and `develop`.
